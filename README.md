# openhouse-data-matching-app
Initial demo showcasing address matching between the open-house data feeds and a simplified client dataset on Namara. Codes are assigned to open-house addresses through Resolver (Entity Resolution) in order to ensure that different formats of the same address are recognized as matches. Cronjobs are run to both check for new matches and to pull the open-house data feeds into the database on a daily basis.
